# ðŸ“° Hacker News Client

## ðŸ“‹ Description

In this project, a basic **Hacker News client** is developed. It fetches the top stories from the **Hacker News API** and displays them in a table. Users can filter and sort the posts based on various criteria. The primary goal is to build a simple, yet functional, application that fetches and displays useful data from a server.

## Testing your implementation

The project contains both traditional tests that can be run with `elm-test` and examples that can be run with `elm-verify-examples`. Before running any tests, you **must** run the following command **once** to install all dependencies:

```
powershell
PS > npm install
To run all tests and see your final grade:

powershell
Copy
Edit
PS > npm run grade
To run all tests and see detailed explanations for all failures:

powershell
Copy
Edit
PS > npm test
To run all tests manually using Elm Test:

powershell
Copy
Edit
PS > npx elm-test
Note: If the tests fail with an exception containing Error: TODO in module <ModuleName>, you must replace the respective call to Debug.todo with a valid Elm value that allows the code to compile.

```
